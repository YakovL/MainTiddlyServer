Bugs and feature requests should also become a <a href="https://github.com/YakovL/MainTiddlyServer/issues">GH issue</a>
but usually it's better to write to the google group first.</p></section><section><header id="contributing">Contributing []</header><p>Any contributions are greatly appreciated. What you can do for the project:<ul><li>help creating a minimal-efforts installer of a win/*nix bundle (server + MTS)</li><li>help creating better password protection: stronger, server- and OS-independent
(suggest a lib if you know a good one or help implement)</li><li>help implement saving for TiddlyWiki5</li><li>[more?]</li><li>[thank/donate]</li></ul></p><p>[how to contribute to code (using g.g; GH)]</p></section><section><header id="perspectives">Perspectives [/roadmap/requests?]</header><p>Several distinct features that are planned/considered to be implemented:<ul><li>planned: collaborative editing (avoid conflicts, show changes on the go)</li><li>planned/semi-implemented: image uploading (insert from clipboard etc)</li><li>to be considered: better backuping? [requested by okido][link?]</li><li>to be considered: support saveAs, extended filesystem operations</li></ul></p><p>Support of TiddlyWiki5 is discussable but somewhat unlikely until somebody helps me with
its core engine (what JS to hijack, saving format etc).</p></section><section> <header id="author-license">Author and [license]</header><p>MainTiddlyServer is a fork of <a href="http://exar.ch/microtiddlyserver/">MicroTiddlyServer</a>
which in turn is a fork of <a href="http://gitorious.org/mts">MiniTiddlyServer</a>.
MainTiddlyServer is developed by Yakov Litvin (versions 1.0.0-1.5.2 were released as
"MicroTiddlyServer" with the "_YL" suffix in the code comments).

the author of TW, and other developers who contributed to the core of TiddlyWiki Classic
and various plugins for it.</p><p>MainTiddlyServer wasn't built from scratch, and some credits should definitely go to Athman,
the author of the MicroTiddlyServer fork, and to the author of the original MiniTiddlyServer
which is sadly unknown to me.</p><p>Last but no least, I'd like to thank the whole TiddlyWiki community for all the discussions,
inspiration and encouragement brought through the google groups.
